//What will be the value stored in the variable x after executing following statement: x=3<0885>0;
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>

void main()
{
    int x;
    x=3<0885>0;
    printf("X = %d",x);
    /*The statement `x=3<0885>0;` is not valid in C. It will raise a syntax error. If you meant `x=3*8850;`, then the value stored in the variable x would be **26550**.
